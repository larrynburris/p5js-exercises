    <h1><a href="p5js.org">P5.js</a> Mouse Interaction</h1>
    <p>The properties <i>mouseX</i> and <i>mouseY</i> represent the current position of the mouse in the canvas. Move the mouse around the canvas to see how the mouse is tracked and the coordinates change.</p>
    <p>The property <i>MouseIsPressed</i> is a boolean that allows you to know if the user is holding the mouse button down. Notice how we darken the background when holding the mouse button down.</p>
    <p>Defining the <i>mousedPressed()</i> function in the sketch file will act as an event handler for mouse presses. See how mouse clicks capture the current mouse position to be drawn as points in future <i>draw()</i> executions.</p>
